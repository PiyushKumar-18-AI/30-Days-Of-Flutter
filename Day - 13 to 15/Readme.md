# Day - 13

On day 13 of my Flutter learning journey, I likely covered two important topics related to file handling in Flutter:

* <b><i>Local Files:</b></i> I likely learned how to read and write files stored locally on the device using Flutter's <i>dart:io library</i>. This is 
useful for storing app-specific data that you need to persist across app launches. You likely learned how to access a file using a path, read the 
contents of a file into a string or a list of bytes, and write to a file.

* <b><i>Load & Decode JSON:</b></i> I likely learned how to load and parse JSON data in Flutter. JSON is a common data format used in APIs and web 
services, and Flutter provides a number of ways to decode JSON data into Dart objects. I likely learned how to use the <i>Dart:convert library</i> to 
parse JSON data and how to handle errors that may occur while decoding.

# Day - 14

On day 14, there was an Q&A session, where individuals likely had the opportunity to ask questions about any aspect of Flutter development, 
including syntax, design patterns, common pitfalls and about JSON and development with it. The session cleared my doubts related to what I 
have learned so far in my Flutter journey. This is a great way to consolidate my knowledge and make sure you have a solid understanding of 
the concepts I've learned.

Having these Q&A sessions helps to identify areas where I may need to focus more attention, and can provide opportunities for me to ask 
questions and clarify any confusion I may have.

# Day - 15

On day 15 of my Flutter learning journey, I likely focused on mapping JSON data to Dart objects, using a data class generator, and adding a 
progress indicator to my app.

* <b><i>JSON Mapping:</b></i> I likely learned how to map JSON data to Dart objects, so that I can work with the data in a more structured 
and manageable way. This is done by defining data classes in Dart and using the <i>Dart:convert library</i> to decode the JSON data into instances of 
these classes.

* <b><i>Data Class Generator:</b></i> I likely learned how to use a data class generator to manually as well as automatically generate the data classes 
based on JSON data. For automatically generating the data classes I used the extension of <i>Visual Studio Code</i> that is 
"<i>Dart Data Class Generator</i>" by <i>hzgood</i>, and this saved a lot of time and effort as compared to manually generating data classes. 
It also saves a lot of time and effort dealing with complex JSON data.

* <b><i>Progress Indicator:</b></i> I likely learned how to add a progress indicator to my app, to indicate that something is loading or processing 
in the background. ProgressIndicator is a widget provided by Flutter that shows a progress bar, spinning wheel, or other visual indication of progress.
