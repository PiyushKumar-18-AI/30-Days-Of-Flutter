## <b>Installing Flutter</b>

* Download the <b>Flutter SDK</b> from the official website <i>(https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)</i>
* Extract the downloaded package to the desired location on your computer.

<b><i> MacOS </i></b>

* Open the terminal and navigate to the extracted Flutter SDK directory.
* Run the following command to add the Flutter command-line tools to your PATH:
<b><i>export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"</i></b>

<b><i> Windows </i></b>

* On Windows, you can do this by running the following command in the Command Prompt: <br><b><i>set PATH=%PATH%;<path_to_flutter_sdk>\flutter\bin</i></b>

* Run the command flutter doctor to check for any dependencies that need to be installed.

## <b>Setting up Visual Studio Code for Flutter</b>


* Install the Flutter extension for Visual Studio Code.
* Open the command palette <i>(Cmd + Shift + P)</i> and run the command <b><i>"Flutter: New Project"</i></b> to create a new Flutter project.
* Open the project in Visual Studio Code and make sure that the Flutter extension is correctly configured by running the command "Flutter: Check for updates"
* You can now run and debug your Flutter app directly from within Visual Studio Code.


It's recommended to have the Dart SDK installed before installing Flutter, as Flutter uses Dart as programming language.

Additionally, you can install and setup some additional extensions like "Dart-Code" and "Flutter IntelliSense" which will provide you with more functionality and autocomplete options while working with flutter and dart.

Make sure to check the official documentation for more detailed instructions and troubleshooting.
