# Day-10

On day 10 of my Flutter learning journey, I likely covered several additional concepts and features of the Flutter framework, including:

* <b><i>Models:</b></i> A model is an object that holds the data for an application. It holds the data in a structured way and defines the properties and behavior 
of that data. In Flutter, models are typically implemented as Dart classes and can be used to hold data for a single object or for a collection 
of objects.

* <b><i>AppBarTheme:</b></i> AppBarTheme is a widget that is used to customize the appearance of the AppBar in a Material App. It allows you to change the color, 
elevation, and other properties of the AppBar to match the theme of your app.

* <b><i>Extracting Theme:</b></i> Extracting Theme refers to the process of separating the theme-related properties of your app into a separate file or class. 
This allows you to easily change the theme of your app without having to make changes in multiple places. It also helps to make your code more 
readable and maintainable.
