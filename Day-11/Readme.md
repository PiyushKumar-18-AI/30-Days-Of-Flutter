On day 11 of my Flutter learning journey, I likely covered several core concepts of the Flutter framework, including:

* <b><i>BuildContext:</b></i> BuildContext is an object that is passed down the widget tree during the build process. It provides information about the location 
of a widget in the widget tree, and is used to access resources such as themes and navigators.

* <b><i>Three Trees:</b></i> In Flutter, there are three main trees that are used to build an app: the widget tree, the element tree, and the render tree. The 
widget tree is the tree of widgets that define the structure of the user interface. The element tree is the tree of elements that are created 
from the widgets and represents the state of the widgets. The render tree is the tree of RenderObjects that are created from the elements and 
is used to paint the user interface on the screen.

* <b><i>Constraints:</b></i> Constraints are used to define the size and position of a widget. They are passed down the widget tree from parent to child and 
are used to determine how much space a widget has available for its layout. Constraints are used by layout widgets to determine the size and 
position of their children.
