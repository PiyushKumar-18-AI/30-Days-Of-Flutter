# Day - 12

On day 12 of your Flutter learning journey, you likely covered several essential concepts and features of the Flutter framework, including:

* <b><i>ListView Builder:</b></i> ListView Builder is a widget that is used to create a scrollable list of widgets. It takes an item builder function as an argument, 
which is called for each item in the list, and returns a widget for that item. This allows you to create dynamic lists that can be updated with new 
data as needed.

* <b><i>List Generate:</b></i> List Generate is a function in Dart that is used to create a list of elements from an existing list or iterable. It takes a function 
as an argument, which is called for each item in the iterable, and returns a new list of elements based on the results of that function.

* <b><i>Card:</b></i> A Card is a Material Design component that is used to display information in a container. It can contain an image, text, buttons, and other 
widgets. Cards are typically used to display items in a grid or list and are often used in apps such as e-commerce, news, and weather apps.

* <b><i>Asserts:</b></i> Asserts are used to check the validity of an argument at runtime. If the argument passed to an assert statement is false, the assert statement 
will throw an exception and stop the execution of the code. Asserts are commonly used to validate the arguments passed to functions, to check the state 
of an object, and to handle errors in an app.
