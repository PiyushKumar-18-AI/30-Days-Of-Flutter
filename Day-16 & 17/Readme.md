# Day-16

On Day 16 of my 30 Days of Flutter journey, I learned about GridView and GridTile.

* <b><i>GridView : </b></i>GridView is a widget in Flutter that allows you to display a grid of widgets. It is commonly used to display a collection 
of items, such as images or texts, in a grid-like layout. The grid items can be arranged in multiple ways, including vertically, horizontally, 
and in a grid format.

* <b><i>GridTile : </b></i>GridTile is a widget that represents a single item in a grid. It is used within a GridView and provides a convenient 
way to display a grid item with a title and a leading widget.

By using GridView and GridTile, you can easily create grid-based layouts in your Flutter app, which are a popular way of displaying items in a mobile app.

# Day-17

On Day 17 of my 30 Days of Flutter journey, I learned about VelocityX, a Flutter UI library.

VelocityX is a UI toolkit for Flutter that makes it easier to build beautiful and responsive apps. It provides a set of pre-designed widgets, 
animations, and design patterns that you can use to create visually appealing user interfaces.

Some of the key features of <b><i>VelocityX </b></i>include:

* A wide range of pre-designed widgets and animations, including buttons, cards, form fields, loading indicators, and more.
* A responsive design system that allows you to create apps that look great on all screen sizes.
* A set of custom-designed themes and colors that you can use to create a consistent look and feel across your app.
* To use VelocityX in your Flutter app, you need to add the <b> 'velocity_x'</b> package to your <b>'pubspec.yaml'</b> file, 
* and then import the library into your Dart code.

By using VelocityX, you can quickly and easily create visually appealing and responsive user interfaces in your Flutter app, without 
having to write a lot of custom code.
