# Day - 18

On Day 18 of my 30 Days of Flutter journey, I learned about Hero Animations, MaterialPageRoute, and Arc.

* <b><i>Hero Animations : </b></i>Hero Animations is a powerful animation feature in Flutter that allows you to animate a widget from one page 
to another when navigating between pages. For example, you can animate an image from one page to another, creating a seamless transition between pages.

* <b><i>MaterialPageRoute : </b></i>MaterialPageRoute is a built-in Flutter class that provides a way to navigate between pages using the Material Design 
navigation paradigm. It provides a smooth, animated transition between pages, as well as support for navigation gestures, such as swipe-to-dismiss.

* <b><i>Arc : </b></i>Arc, on the other hand, is a custom widget that allows you to create circular shapes with curved edges. You can use it to 
create custom animations and designs in your Flutter app.

By using these features, you can create engaging and visually appealing animations and transitions in your Flutter app.
