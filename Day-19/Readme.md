# Day-19

On Day 19 of my 30 Days of Flutter journey, I learned about dummy text and I added dummy text using VS Code Extension - Dummy Text Generator by GÃ¼ray
Yarar. Dummy text is basically a is placeholder text that is used to demonstrate the visual effects of different typefaces and layouts, without relying 
on meaningful content. I also learned about FloatingActionButton, which is a material design circular floating action button that is typically used to
promote a promoted action and in our application I used this floating action button for redirecting to Cart Page whichwould likely display items that the
user has selected for purchase.
