# Day-19

On Day 19 of my 30 Days of Flutter journey, I learned about dummy text and how to add dummy text. Dummy text is basically a is placeholder text 
that is used to demonstrate the visual effects of different typefaces and layouts, without relying on meaningful content. I also learned about 
FloatingActionButton, which is a material design circular floating action button that is typically used to promote a promoted action and in our application 
I used this floating action button for redirecting to Cart Page whichwould likely display items that the user has selected for purchase.
