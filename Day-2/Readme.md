## Day 2 Flutter Learning: Learned about Dart Programming Language, Data Types, and Scaffold

* On day 2 of learning Flutter, I learned about the Dart programming language, which is the programming language that is used to build Flutter apps. Dart is an object-oriented language that is similar to other popular languages such as Java and C#. It is easy to learn for people with experience in object-oriented programming languages and has features such as classes, interfaces, and mixins.

* I also learned about data types in Dart, which are the different kinds of values that a programming language can handle. This includes basic data types such as numbers, strings, and booleans, as well as more complex data types such as lists and maps. Understanding data types is important for working with data in Flutter and creating efficient code.

* Lastly, I learned about Scaffold, which is a fundamental layout element in Flutter. Scaffold is a base layout that provides a consistent structure to an app, including an app bar, a drawer, and a bottom navigation bar. It also provides a space to add other widgets, such as a body, which can be used to hold the main content of the app. Understanding how to use Scaffold is important for creating a consistent and structured layout for a Flutter app.
