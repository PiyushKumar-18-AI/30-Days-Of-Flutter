## Day-3

On day 3 of my Flutter learning journey, I likely covered some fundamental concepts of the Flutter framework, including:

* <b><i>Functions:</b></i> Functions are blocks of code that can be called by other parts of the app to perform a specific task. In Flutter, functions are used to handle user interactions, update the state of the app, and perform other tasks.

* <b><i>Classes:</b></i> Classes are templates for creating objects, which are instances of a class. In Flutter, classes are used to define the structure and behavior of widgets, which are the building blocks of the app's user interface.

* <b><i>Routes:</b></i> Routes are used to navigate between different pages or screens in a Flutter app. Each route is associated with a unique URL, and users can navigate to a route by opening the URL or by using navigation buttons or other controls in the app.

* <b><i>Theme:</b></i> The theme of an app controls the overall look and feel, including the colors, fonts, and other design elements. I can use the ThemeData class to customize the theme of a Flutter app.

* <b><i>Text:</b></i> Text is a fundamental building block of a user interface, used to display text in an app. In Flutter, the Text widget is used to display text on the screen. I can customize the appearance of text by using the TextStyle class.

## Main Page Code

I have made the Initial Route method to Home Page, that's why Home Page is reflected on Simulator and if off then because of Routes method will reflect Login Page on Simulator.
