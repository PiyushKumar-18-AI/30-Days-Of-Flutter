## Day-3

On day 3 of your Flutter learning journey, you likely covered some fundamental concepts of the Flutter framework, including:

* <b><i>Functions:</b></i> Functions are blocks of code that can be called by other parts of the app to perform a specific task. In Flutter, functions are used to handle user interactions, update the state of the app, and perform other tasks.

* <b><i>Classes:</b></i> Classes are templates for creating objects, which are instances of a class. In Flutter, classes are used to define the structure and behavior of widgets, which are the building blocks of the app's user interface.

* <b><i>Routes:</b></i> Routes are used to navigate between different pages or screens in a Flutter app. Each route is associated with a unique URL, and users can navigate to a route by opening the URL or by using navigation buttons or other controls in the app.

* <b><i>Theme:</b></i> The theme of an app controls the overall look and feel, including the colors, fonts, and other design elements. You can use the ThemeData class to customize the theme of a Flutter app.

* <b><i>Text:</b></i> Text is a fundamental building block of a user interface, used to display text in an app. In Flutter, the Text widget is used to display text on the screen. You can customize the appearance of text by using the TextStyle class.

You likely also started to implement these concepts in a practice app, creating functions, classes and using them in widgets, creating routes and navigating between them, applying a custom theme, and displaying text in the app using the Text widget.

It's important to practice what you learned and continue to build on it by creating more complex apps that use these concepts in different ways.
