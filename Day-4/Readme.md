## Day-4

On day 4 of my Flutter learning journey, I likely covered some additional concepts and features of the Flutter framework, including:

<b><i>Images:</b></i> In Flutter, images can be displayed in an app using the Image widget. You can load images from assets, network, or file system. There are also options to set the width, height, and scale of the image.

<b><i>Google Fonts:</b></i> You can easily use Google Fonts in your flutter app by using a package called google_fonts. It allows you to easily download and use any of the fonts from the Google Fonts library.

<b><i>ElevatedButton:</b></i> ElevatedButton is a Material Design raised button. It's used for medium-emphasis actions. It's similar to a FlatButton but with added elevation.

I used all these concepts on the Login Page and viewed my progress. 

## Code of Login Page after Updatation

I have add an image to the login page and also a Username and Password Text-Field Form.


## Code of Update in Pubsec.yaml

I updated the pubsec.yaml file to work with images and change the font of application using Google Fonts.


## Code of Updated Main.dart
