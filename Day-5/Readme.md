# Day-5

On day 5 of my Flutter learning journey, I likely covered some additional concepts and features of the Flutter framework, including:

<i><b>SingleChildScrollView:</i></b> The SingleChildScrollView widget is used to display a scrolling view that contains a single child. It's useful when you have a small piece of content that you want to scroll, such as a list of items, a form, or a small piece of text.

<i><b>Navigator:</i></b> The Navigator widget is used to manage the navigation stack in a Flutter app. It's responsible for managing the routes and maintaining the history of the app. It allows you to push and pop routes, and it keeps track of the current route.

I have also implemented these concepts in a practice app, using the SingleChildScrollView to create a scrollable view and the Navigator to manage the navigation stack and create routes.
