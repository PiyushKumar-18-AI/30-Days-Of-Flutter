# Day-6

On day 6 of my Flutter learning journey, I likely covered some additional concepts and features of the Flutter framework, including:

<b><i>Stateful:</b></i> A stateful widget is a widget that holds mutable state. Stateful widgets are created by extending the StatefulWidget class. 
They can hold data that can change over time, such as user input or a list of items.

<b><i>Animated Container:</b></i> The AnimatedContainer widget is a convenience widget that animates the properties of a container. 
It allows you to animate the size, position, and other properties of a container in a smooth way.

<b><i>Future Delay:</b></i> Future is a way of representing a potential value, or error, that will be available at some time in the future. 
In flutter, you can use the <b><i>"Future.delayed()"</b></i> method to delay the execution of a task for a certain amount of time.

Today, I updated the <b><i>Login Page</b></i> and during the updation I noticed the difference between <i>Stateless Widget</i> and <i>Stateful Widget</i> 
after that we used <i>Animated Container</i> instead of <i>Elevated Button</i> and made a few changes to the <b><i>Login Page</b></i> and we also added the <i>Future Delay</i> 
feature and saw what this feature does.
