# Day - 7 

On day 7 of my Flutter learning journey, it seemed to focus on clearing doubts and answering questions related to the concepts 
covered in the previous days. This is an important step in the learning process as it allows you to solidify your understanding of the material 
and address any areas where anyone may be struggling.

During this session, I likely had the opportunity to ask questions and get clarification on specific concepts, troubleshoot any issues I 
was encountering while building my practice app, and receive guidance on how to move forward with your learning.
