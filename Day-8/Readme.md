# Day-8

On day 8 of your Flutter learning journey, you likely covered some additional concepts and features of the Flutter framework, including:

<b><i>Form:</b></i> A Form is a container for FormFields, it is used to validate and manage the input of a user. A Form can contain one or more FormFields 
and can be used to create a form with text fields, radio buttons, and other input elements.

<b><i>TextField Validation:</b></i> TextField validation is the process of ensuring that the input provided by the user is valid. This can include checking 
that the input is in the correct format, that it falls within a certain range, or that it matches a specific pattern.

I also encountered the difference between Ink and Animated Container widgets. 
In Flutter both of them serve different purposes.

* <b><i>Ink:</b></i> Ink is an interactive visual effect that indicates a button press or touch. It can be added to any widget, and it creates a ripple effect when the 
widget is pressed. Ink is mainly used for creating a feedback effect for the user when they interact with a button.

* <b><i>Animated Container:</b></i> The AnimatedContainer widget is a convenience widget that animates the properties of a container. It allows you to animate the size, 
position, and other properties of a container in a smooth way. The AnimatedContainer widget allows you to animate the changes of a container's properties, 
such as width, height, color, and more. It is mainly used for creating animations and transitions between different pages or widgets.

In short, Ink provides an interactive visual effect while Animated Container provides an animation effect.
