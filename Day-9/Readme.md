# Day - 9

On day 9 of my Flutter learning journey, I likely covered several additional concepts and features of the Flutter framework, including:

* <b><i>Material Drawer:</b></i> The Material Drawer is a navigation drawer that is used to navigate through different pages or sections of an app. It is 
typically accessed by swiping from the left edge of the screen or by clicking on a hamburger menu icon. It can contain links to different 
pages, sections, or settings of the app.

* <b><i>DevTools:</b></i> DevTools is a set of tools provided by the Flutter framework that can be used to debug and develop Flutter apps. It includes a 
widget inspector, performance profiler, and other tools that can be used to improve the development process.

* <b><i>ListView:</b></i> The ListView widget is used to display a scrolling list of widgets. It can be used to display items in a list, grid, or other 
layout. ListView is a scrolling container that contains multiple widgets, it can be used to create dynamic lists of items.

* <b><i>NetworkImage:</b></i> NetworkImage is a widget that is used to display an image from a URL. It can be used to display images that are stored on a 
remote server, rather than being bundled with the app.
