# 30-Days-Of-Flutter

Welcome to the 30 Days of Flutter repository! This repository is dedicated to tracking my daily progress as I learn and work with the Flutter framework. Each day, I will be committing updates to this repository that include my thoughts, challenges, and accomplishments for that day.

This repository contains a series of folders, each corresponding to a specific day in the 30 day period. Each folder will have its own README file that provides a summary of what was accomplished on that day and includes any relevant code snippets or screenshots.

Feel free to fork this repository and use it as a guide for your own Flutter learning journey. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy coding!

So many of you before starting would have a question <b><i>Why Flutter</i></b>? 

So, <b><i>Flutter</i></b> is an open-source mobile application development framework created by <b><i>Google</i></b>. It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, and the web.

There are several reasons why Flutter is a popular choice for mobile app development:

* <b><i>Hot Reload:</i></b> Flutter's "hot reload" feature allows developers to quickly and easily experiment, build UIs, add features, and fix bugs.

* <b><i>High Performance:</i></b> Flutter's use of the Dart programming language and its reactive programming model allows for high-performance apps that run smoothly on both iOS and Android.

* <b><i>Customizable and Expressive UI:</i></b> Flutter provides a rich set of customizable widgets and flexible APIs for building expressive and beautiful user interfaces.

* <b><i>Single Codebase:</i></b> Flutter allows developers to build for multiple platforms with a single codebase, saving time and resources.

* <b><i>Growing Community:</i></b> Flutter has a growing and supportive community of developers who contribute to the development of the framework, and provide support to one another.

Overall, Flutter's features and capabilities make it a popular choice for mobile app development because it allows developers to build high-performance, expressive, and visually attractive apps quickly and efficiently.

Next Question is <b><i>How to Use this Repository?</b></i>

So, for using this repository to learn from, I have added all the files that you just need to update in <b>"lib folder"</b> of the Flutter app you create 
in your Local Machine and by using the days, you can follow this repository. 

And for instance if you get stuck anywhere you can either <b>Ping Me</b> using the links given in <b>My Profile</b> or you can watch the videos of 
<b><i> @Codepur </b></i> from where I have learnt and boost my Flutter Develoment Profile.
